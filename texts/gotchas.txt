# Gotchas

The names of authors are retrieved from the data of the commits, not from Github. The tool assumes that the authors belong to Github accounts.
As as a result, this has the side-effect of breaking the link to the author's Github profile page.

All changes are clumped into one purpose, the `added` purpose. Of the commits used above, only one fits this purpose.

The category of all changes is assumed `any`.
