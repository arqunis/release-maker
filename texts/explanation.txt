# Explanation

The input of the tool is json containing a URL to the git repository, and four classes that classify commits based on their function.
The resulting output is markdown-formatted text.

The output is generated as the following:
- Credit to all the authors in a list that is sorted alphabetically.
- The "Added" class. Indicates that commits add new behaviour or functionality.
- The "Changed" class. Indicates that commits alter pre-existing behaviour or functionality.
- The "Fixed" class. Indicates that commits amend broken behaviour or functionality.
- The "Removed" class. Indicates that commits remove behaviour or functionality.
- Lastly, text that is hidden when rendered. Provides links to the authors' homepages and repository URLs to the commit hashes.

The classes are optional; any class may be omitted. They're composed of items.
An item in a class is comprised of four things: category, name, author(s), commit hash(es).
A category describes the location where the commits have been applied.
A name can be anything, but it is preferred to use a commit name when there is just one (see below).
There may be just one, or many authors. In the case of one, specify a string. In the case of many, use an array of strings.
Similarly, there may be just one commit, or set of commits that collectively have brought changes for a specific purpose. In case of one, one string. In case of many, array of strings.
